# Coming Soon - Vegan Hybrid Athlete Nutrition

In future posts, I'll cover how to eat vegan in a way to build muscle and run faster including: 
- Nutrition basics: calories, macros, micros, then phytonutrients
- Nutrition for running
- Nutrition for building muscle
- Protein: how much do you need and how can vegans get enough
- Debunking myths of a vegan diet
- Meal timing for building muscle and strength
- Supplements (could be a tag but not on the top menu)

Stay tuned!
