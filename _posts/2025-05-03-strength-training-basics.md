# Strength Training Basics — How to Train for Power

If your goal is to increase your one-rep max, build denser muscles, or just feel powerful in your movements, you’re in the right place.

In this post, we’ll cover the fundamentals of strength training: how to structure your workouts for maximum power, what rep ranges to use, how much rest to take, and which exercises give you the most bang for your buck.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Strength Training 101

### **Volume**
3–5 sets of 3–5 reps, performed 3–5 times per week *per muscle group*. The emphasis here is intensity—not just how much work you do, but how *heavy* you lift.

### **Reps**
No need to train to failure. Instead, focus on high-quality reps with perfect form. You want to train your nervous system, not just fatigue your muscles.

### **Rep Tempo**
Cadence isn't critical, but a 3-1-1 pattern (3 seconds down, 1-second pause, 1 second up) ensures control and force production.

### **Rest Between Sets**
2–5 minutes. This gives your body time to restore ATP so you can bring full power to your next set.

### **Weight**
Lift at 70% or more of your 1-rep max. These sets should feel heavy and require full concentration.

### **Exercise Selection**
Stick mostly to compound movements like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, overhead presses, and rows. Balance push/pull movements (horizontal and vertical) for full-body development.

## 🍽 Nutrition + Recovery for Strength

- **Protein**: Aim for 1g per pound of bodyweight daily.
- **Calories**: A small surplus can help, but it’s not essential. Avoid under-eating if you want to keep getting stronger.
- **Recovery**: Prioritize sleep and give muscles 48–72 hours between heavy sessions.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Strength training is about consistency, form, and load progression—not chasing soreness or burnout. When done right, it builds a foundation that benefits running, athletic performance, and long-term health.
