**Welcome to the Vegan Hybrid Athlete Blog**

Whether you're trying to build muscle, run a marathon, or do both on a plant-based diet, welcome — you’re in the right place.

This blog is dedicated to helping vegan hybrid athletes thrive through evidence-based training and nutrition. Here, you’ll find clear, practical guidance on how to build strength, improve endurance, recover smarter, and eat to fuel performance — all rooted in science and experience, not hype or misinformation.

There’s a lot of confusion out there: that you can’t build muscle on a vegan diet, that running kills gains, or that you need to suffer through protein powders and bland meals to see results. I'm here to cut through that noise and offer a better way — one that’s grounded in research, adapted for real life, and designed to help you perform and feel your best.

Over time, I’ll be publishing articles on:
- **Strength Training:** From foundational training principles to targeted strategies for hypertrophy, fat loss, and improving functional strength.
- **Endurance Running:** Including base-building, race training (marathon and half), injury recovery, and how to blend running with lifting.
- **Nutrition for Athletes:** Demystifying plant-based fueling, protein needs, timing, supplementation, and breaking down persistent myths about vegan diets.
- **Recovery:** What really supports recovery (hint: it’s not just foam rolling), and how to balance training intensity with rest.
- **Quick-Start Guides:** For those ready to dive into building muscle, running long, or going vegan — no fluff, just actionable steps.

Whether you're a long-time vegan, plant-curious, or simply want to train smarter and eat better, this blog is for you.

Thanks for being here. Let’s get stronger, faster, and healthier — together.
