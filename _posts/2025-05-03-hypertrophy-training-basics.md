# Hypertrophy Training Basics ‚Äî How to Train for Size

Want to build bigger muscles? Then hypertrophy training is your go-to.

While strength training builds the engine, hypertrophy training builds the frame‚Äîlarger muscle fibers, greater muscular endurance, and the aesthetics most people associate with ‚Äúlooking fit.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs how to structure your training to maximize growth.

## üß± Hypertrophy Training 101

### **Volume**
8‚Äì15 reps per set, with 15‚Äì20 working sets *per muscle group* per week. Volume is the biggest driver of hypertrophy.

### **Reps**
You don‚Äôt need to train to absolute failure, but aim to be within 1‚Äì2 reps of it. Quality still matters: control your reps and use good form.

### **Rep Tempo**
Use a 2-1-1 cadence: 2 seconds down, 1-second pause, 1 second up. This allows for time under tension without sacrificing form.

### **Rest Between Sets**
30‚Äì60 seconds is typical, though longer rest doesn‚Äôt harm growth. Focus more on getting your total weekly volume and increasing it over time.

### **Weight**
Choose weights that let you complete 8‚Äì15 reps with challenge. Track progress and aim to increase weight or reps over time (progressive overload).

### **Exercise Selection**
Combine compound lifts with isolation work. For example, pair bench presses with chest flys, or squats with leg extensions. Isolation lifts help you bring up lagging muscles and improve symmetry.

## üçΩ Nutrition + Recovery for Size

- **Protein**: 1g per pound of bodyweight daily.
- **Calories**: A caloric surplus (~10% above maintenance) is necessary for muscle growth. Too much surplus = more fat gain. Dial it in.
- **Recovery**: You grow outside the gym‚Äîso sleep, manage stress, and don‚Äôt train the same muscle group hard two days in a row.

## üß† Final Thoughts

Hypertrophy training is perfect for building muscle mass, improving body composition, and even helping with injury resilience. Combined with smart nutrition and recovery, it‚Äôs one of the most powerful tools in your hybrid athlete toolkit.

If you‚Äôre someone who runs, lifts, and juggles a busy life, hypertrophy training offers a great way to build a physique that performs and lasts.
