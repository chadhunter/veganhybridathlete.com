# Coming Soon - Running Faster and Farther, Faster

In future posts, I'll be covering science-based and evidence-based running training 
including: 
- Training basics (e.g., base running and capacity building, threshold training, VO2max 
training, anaerobic training, and strength training to compliment running)
- Marathon training 
- Half-marathon training 
- Starting to run again after an injury 
- Comparing common marathon training plans

Stay tuned!
