# Coming Soon - Recovery to Maximize Performance

In future posts, I'll cover strategies to improve recovery so you can feel better, 
train more, and improve faster, including: 
- What is delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
- Recovery for the different biological systems: nervous system, muscular, cardiovascular 
- How eating, sleeping, and stress impact recovery
- How long to rest between training 
- Biohacks that can improve recovery (ones that actually work)

Stay tuned!
