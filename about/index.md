Hi, I'm Chad, a vegan hybrid athlete. I've been lifting, running, playing soccer, 
hiking, and enjoying adventures with my wife and pup for years. Over that time, I've 
listened to hundreds of podcasts, read dozens of books, watched hundreds videos, and 
countless blogs around building muscle, losing fat, improving your cardiovascular 
endurance, eating vegan (specifically, a whole-food plant-based diet) to fuel your 
performance. 

What surprised me throughout my journey is how few concepts there are to achieve these 
goals, but how much misinformation and confusion is out there. There are so many websites, 
influencers (sales reps), and magazines (looking at you *Men's Health*) that seem to 
purposely confuse you so that you never reach your goals and continue to rely on their
supplements or other products in the hope of someday looking more fit.  

Enter this blog which I've created as a free service to cut through the confusion and
help others that are interested in building muscle, losing fat, running farther and 
faster, and fueling their performance with a whole-food, plant based diet (although, 
most of the content works regardless of your diet!). I've added the many insights I've 
accumulated over the years, all backed by science rather than affiliate partnerships.

If you find this useful, want to contribute, or just want to go for a run sometime, 
please reach out!
