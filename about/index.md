Hi, I'm Chad, a vegan hybrid athlete. I've been lifting, running, playing soccer, 
hiking, and enjoying adventures with my wife and pup for years. Over that time, I've 
listened to hundreds of podcasts, read dozens of books, watched hundreds videos, and 
read countless blogs around building muscle, losing fat, improving your cardiovascular 
endurance, and eating vegan (specifically, a whole-food plant-based diet) to fuel your 
performance. 

Two things suprised me throughout my journey: (1) how few concepts there are to achieve these 
goals and (2) how much misinformation and confusion is out there. There are so many websites, 
influencers (sales reps), and magazines (looking at you *Men's Health*) that seem to 
purposely confuse you so that you never reach your goals and continue to rely on their
supplements or other products in the hope of someday looking more fit.  

That's why I've created this website as a free service to cut through the confusion and
help others that are interested in building muscle, losing fat, running farther and 
faster, and fueling their performance with a whole-food, plant based diet (although, 
most of the content works regardless of your diet!). I've distilled down and structured 
all the key insights I've accumulated over the years (backed by science and personal testing, 
rather than affiliate partnerships or sales models) and removed the ones that were 
misguided (like Tim Ferriss' *The 4-Hour Body* which had a few good insights but mostly 
was just misguided information).

If you find this useful, want to contribute, or just want to go for a run sometime, 
please reach out!
